[mod-setting-description]
aircraft-realism-turn-radius=Widens the turn radius of the planes
aircraft-realism-acceleration=Decreases the acceleration of planes for longer needed takeoff distance
aircraft-realism-braking-speed=Reduces the braking force, increasing the braking distance
aircraft-realism-takeoff-health=Increased plane damage hitting objects on takeoff / landing
aircraft-realism-fuel-usage-multiplier-grounded=How much to multiply fuel usage of grounded planes
aircraft-realism-fuel-usage-multiplier-airborne=How much to multiply fuel usage of airborne planes
aircraft-realism-strict-runway-checking=Planes must takeoff and land from tiles considered runways, which are tiles with a vehicle friction modifier less than max vehicle friction modifier
aircraft-realism-strict-runway-checking-maximum-tile-vehicle-friction=If runway requirement is enabled, planes must takeoff from tiles with a vehicle friction modifier less than to what is set here
aircraft-realism-strict-runway-max-taxi-speed=The max speed planes can travel at when not on a runway, exceeding this will deal damage to the plane
